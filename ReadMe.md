# Testbed

- A generic testbed to fool around
- Contains all kinds of Windows binaries e.g.
	- Console application (CLI, .exe)
	- Desktop application (GUI, .exe)
	- Screen saver (.scr)
	- Service (.exe)
	- Shared library (.dll)
	- Static library (.lib)

- Relatively clean and simple templates to start working on a project
